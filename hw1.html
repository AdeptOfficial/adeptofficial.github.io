            As a kid, I have always loved sci-fi shows such as Sword Art Online. The series showcases a brand new virtual world for gamers to socialize and play in an old fashioned RPG style.
            It stated that the technology that helped create the world came out this year in 2022. While in reality, we are still not at that level, but VR and AR technologies have still ca   me a long way. 
            The showcase of static goggles from the 90s, to now with head mounted displays like Quest 2 from Meta, and room scale displays like CAVE2 shows how much technology has advanced. 
            It excites me to see the future of this technology. It has always been the topic of society, “will it be the next new thing that will change our lives forever?”.

            With that, there are advantages of different VR and AR platforms that were showcased. VR is limited by roomspace, but allows a full immersion with the fully artificial environment. 
            This is most applicable with an empty space allowing users to fully move their bodies. VR opens a new world for marketing potential. Allowing new business to form from VR such as VR games! 
            One of the most popular games is Beat Saber, where it allows users to immerse into their favorite music while having a great cardio exercise! In the future with the correct tools,
            new business models can be reached with more social interactions online like using VRchat, creating the fully immersive metaverse.

            Whereas the advantages of AR allows users to use smart devices to create virtual objects overlaid on top of the real world.
            While it is limited by the space on the smart device and it is not as immersive as VR, it enhances the users’ experience with the real world with digital objects.
            The concept of AR opens up a new market for smart gadgets as many startups and even big companies like Google tried to get into. What’s good about AR technology is the visualization of objects. From an education standpoint, you are able to learn things around the world. Scanning with the device, allowing us to reach pages like wikipedia to learn more information on the object.
            And if the technology further advances, we might be able to provide a life size hologram of the object through the smart device, allowing the users to experience the object better.

        While the attempts to make it mainstream occurred over the past decades, it seems like it can never get there as the gold standard.
        Meta recently spent billions of dollars on advertising the “metaverse” but got backlashes from the community with their low quality world that looks like it was from the 2010s.
        Google created smart goggles that shocked the world, but it ended with a whip as people stopped caring about it due to the visual look of having it on.
        And with all that being said, I am still extremely interested in where the technology will go. All of the products we see and use today are created through constant trial and error, same goes to this field.
        I see the potential market for both VR and AR technology.
        It opens up more business marketing opportunities, allowing more startups and competition to form, which will further push the technology forward to improve our lives.
